## üìùCustomization

### Adding New Players
Edit the `playersData` array in `script.js`:

```javascript
{
    id: "player_id",
    name: "Player Name",
    country: "Country",
    role: "Batsman/Bowler/All-rounder",
    matches: 100,
    runs: 5000,
    average: 50.0,
    centuries: 15,
    strikeRate: 85.5
}
```

### Modifying Prediction Algorithm
The prediction logic is in the `makePrediction()` function in `script.js`. You can adjust:
- Base prediction weights
- Format factors
- Weather impact
- Pitch condition effects
- Temperature influences
