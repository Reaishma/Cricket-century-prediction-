# Cricket-century-prediction-
A machine learning model that can predict whether a will score century based on their performance metrics 
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in cricket analytics providing insights into century scoring potential 
Features:

1. Data Collection: Gathered data on cricketers' performance metrics, such as runs scored, strike rate, balls faced, fours, sixes, and centuries.
2. Feature Engineering: Created new features like Run Rate, Boundary Percentage, Dot Ball Percentage, Run Rate vs Strike Rate Ratio, Boundary to Dot Ball Ratio, and Runs per Ball Faced.
3. Model Selection: Used a Random Forest Classifier to predict centuries.

Skills:

1. Machine Learning: Applied machine learning concepts to build a predictive model.
2. Data Analysis: Worked with datasets to extract meaningful insights.
3. Feature Engineering: Created new features to improve model performance.

Tools and Technologies:

1. Machine Learning Algorithms: Used Random Forest Classifier.
2. Data Preprocessing: Utilized techniques like feature scaling and encoding.
3. Model Evaluation: Used metrics like accuracy score and classification report.

Outcomes:

1. Predictive Insights: The model provides predictions on century scoring potential.
2. Performance Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy score and classification report.
3. Model Improvement: Identified areas for improvement, such as tuning hyperparameters and experimenting with different algorithms
